While prior experience is not an absolute requirement, students should be willing to embrace the NCCoE mission and demonstrate an aptitude for learning and developing to be successful. The student will work with a mentor and will be integrated into the activities undertaken by the NCCoE Community Profile team. The student will conduct research on specific sectors where a gap exists for Community Profiles and determine methods/solutions for managing Community Profiles efforts. The final output will be for the student to create a research poster of work. The student will be assigned project tasks based on qualifications or interests and will be able to recommend and possibly pursue additional project areas of interest. Students are also encouraged to consider using this project-based learning experience as the focus of undergraduate research projects and/or other academic or research requirements for their degree. The student shall be expected to come in person to NIST Gaithersburg and NCCoE Rockville for meetings and trainings, however, will be able to telework on a case-by-case basis. The student shall work with the mentor on schedule and identify where he/she has a conflict with their schedule.</p>

Human-centered cybersecurity is an approach that puts people at the forefront when designing and implementing cybersecurity systems, products, and processes by considering human needs, motivations, behaviors, and abilities. Under the guidance of a NIST sponsor, the student will contribute to a project to develop a standard description of human-centered cybersecurity. In addition, the student will help develop guidance, mapped to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, on how to apply HCC concepts within organizations. The work will include data collection and analysis for a research study aimed at understanding current perceptions of human-centered cybersecurity among various groups of cybersecurity stakeholders. The student will also assist NIST staff with mapping HCC concepts to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework by searching for and summarizing applicable human factors frameworks, organizing and synthesizing public comments, and writing guidance. This is an excellent opportunity to contribute to community standards for human-centered cybersecurity that may be used around the world.</p>

The candidate will explore assessing the indicators of a given AI-related risk, determining how to identify them, and providing annotators with examples to annotate the presence of various risks. The project aims to develop an annotation framework for AI risk assessment and establish metrics for data quality in AI risk research, supporting broader work at NIST in assessing and measuring the validity and reliability of AI-related risks in data annotation.</p>

Initially, this project will focus on the recovery of critical elements such as In, Ge, and Sb from microelectronic waste. Essential thermodynamic and kinetic measurements will be conducted to improve the efficiency of vacuum distillation efforts to recover critical materials. These data will be used to improve existing computational thermodynamic and kinetic databases. The experimental measurements will be used in conjunction with available literature data to enable extrapolation to multicomponent systems. This work will include the development of new methods to integrate the measured experimental uncertainties with the available literature reported uncertainties.</p>

We are expanding our research to develop ways of maximizing the value of U.S. microelectronics and semiconductors based on principles of circular economy. Microelectronics are valued for their processing capabilities and the materials that they contain. Operations research is applied to enable value recovery from the perspective of measuring the flow of materials, used in semiconductors, throughout the economy. We create methods to measure what, when and how much material will become available in the future and viable pathways for reclaiming those materials into the economy. By applying advanced forecasting methods to establish and validate circular pathways for microelectronic recovery, the project will deliver science-based techniques that strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. The results will include a suite of decision support tools (metrics, models, and published research) to improve recovery outcomes, thereby strengthening supply chain resiliency via new material sources, and enabling stakeholders to respond dynamically to material availability challenges in the future.</p>

                                        <p class="text-gray-600">NIST’s Engineering Lab (EL) Systems Integration Division, Life Cycle Engineering Group, is seeking a researcher in product design for microelectronic circularity. We are expanding our research to develop ways of maximizing the value of U.S. microelectronics and semiconductors based on principles of the circular economy. Microelectronics are valued for their processing capabilities and the materials that they contain. Our team, together with our external partners, is developing new practices for design that will better enable recovery.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p class="text-gray-600">The design research aspects of the work explore new ways to integrate circularity assessment into the design of products containing microelectronics. We are developing new metrics and measurement methods to allow designers to assess and plan for the recoverability of these complex products. Additionally, this work focuses on the identification of information and data needs to provide decision support to consumers and enable end-of-life stakeholders (recyclers, municipalities, waste managers, infrastructure providers) that improve the volume of valuable microelectronics to be recovered.</p>                                    
                                        <br>
                                        <p class="text-gray-600">The methods developed in this work will be used to inform future product design and may be a basis for corporate or open standards. We will drive the state of the art forward with advanced techniques in life cycle assessment, simulation, and AI- and data-driven design. Results will include a suite of decision support tools (metrics, models, and published research) and new standards to improve recovery outcomes, thereby strengthening supply chain resiliency via new material sources, and enabling stakeholders to respond dynamically to material availability challenges in the future.</p>
